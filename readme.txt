== FAQ ==

= My WordPress site has a sticky header that uses position fixed causing it to cover the WordPress Alert Bar, how can I fix this? =

**WordPress Alert Bar** comes with a filter that allows you to define your sites fixed header so that it can account for the alert bar. Simply navigate to the functions.php file in your child theme and paste in the following code snippet, making sure to replace .site-header with the class or ID of your sites fixed position header.

`
// Define fixed header for Wordpress Alert Bar
add_filter( 'mbwpab_fixed_header_selector', 'mbwpab_define_fixed_header' );
function mbwpab_define_fixed_header( $header ) {
	$header 	=	'.site-header';
	return $header;
}
